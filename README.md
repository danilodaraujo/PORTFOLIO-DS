# Data Science Portfolio by Danilo Araujo

This is a work in progress portfolio of **data science** projects. The projects are listed by their objectives (Data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, Machine learning, etc) and have been summarized on Rpubs reports.

## NLP

### Word Suggestion and Shiny

### [Report](http://rpubs.com/danilodaraujo/wordsuggestion) - [Shiny Application](https://danilodaraujo.shinyapps.io/wordsuggestion/)

This projects shows how can we use a large dataset to teach a machine to suggest the next word to the user. The code uses the idea of Markov chains and a stupid backoff model to predict the next most probable word.  

A shiny application was also developed to ease the interaction with the user. Due to the application processing restrictions, the "accuracy" vs "response time" trade off played a significant challenge in the development of the project.

## Data Assembling and Cleaning

### Data assembling and Table structuring of a tidy compreensible dataset

### [Report](http://rpubs.com/danilodaraujo/dataassembling)

In this project we go step by step over data importing and table structuring and cleaning. The final result is a .csv file with a table that is tidy, compreensible, has no missing values or outliers and can be readly imported and used.

## Machine Learning

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This is an ideal project to put machine learning to practice. In it we highlight the importance of feature engineering and data exploration to increase the accuracy of our random forest classification model.
