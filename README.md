This is a compilation of **data science** projects. The projects are listed by their objectives (Data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, Machine learning, etc) and have been summarized on Rpubs reports.

### [Report](http://rpubs.com/danilodaraujo/wordsuggestion) - [Shiny Application](https://danilodaraujo.shinyapps.io/wordsuggestion/)

This projects shows how can we use a large dataset to teach a machine to suggest the next word to the user. The code uses the idea of Markov chains and a stupid backoff model to predict the next most probable word.  

A shiny application was also developed to ease the interaction with the user. Due to the application processing restrictions, the "accuracy" vs "response time" trade off played a significant challenge in the development of the project.

  

## Data Assembling and Cleaning

### [Report](http://rpubs.com/danilodaraujo/dataassembling)

In this project we go step by step over data importing and table structuring and cleaning. The final result is a .csv file with a table that is tidy, compreensible, has no missing values or outliers and can be readly imported and used.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Machine Learning
